# -VIDEO-STEGANOGRAPHY-SECURE-DATA-HIDING-
Description : Video Steganography is to hide the existence of the message from unauthorized party using Video as cover file and hiding data in video. Steganography means covered writing it includes process of concealing information within other file and also conceals the fact that a secret message is being sent. In this paper a technique proposed is Hash based least significant bit technique for video steganography. Least Significant Bit insertion method embed data in the lower bits of RGB pixel of video and these changes will be minimal. Data hiding is the process of embedding information in a video without changing its perceptual quality and also keep away from knowledge of existence of message. A hash function is used to select the position of insertion in LSB bits. This technique deals with two terms that are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Mean Square Error (MSE).Its objective is to reduce MSE and increase PSNR.
